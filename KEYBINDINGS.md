# Keybindings Reference

Hypercube uses consistent vim-style keybindings across all tools. This document
provides a complete reference.

## The 3-tier model

Hypercube spans a host desktop and the `devc` container, and your keystrokes pass
through several programs at once. To avoid the "keyboard dance," keys follow one
rule: **one modifier per layer, never overlapping.** You only ever reach for one
of three things, and they live in different worlds:

| Press | Talks to | Layer |
|---|---|---|
| **`Super` + …** | the OS | Hyprland windows & workspaces |
| **`Ctrl+Space`** then a key | the multiplexer | zellij (inside `devc`): panes, tabs, sessions, agents |
| **`Space` + …** | the editor | Neovim (LazyVim) |

`Ctrl+Space` is a single **leader**: tap it to enter one mode, then press one key.
There is no pane-mode vs tab-mode vs resize-mode to juggle. See
[KEYBINDINGS-PROPOSAL.md](KEYBINDINGS-PROPOSAL.md) for the full rationale
([#198](https://github.com/binarypie-dev/hypercube/issues/198)).

> The scheme is now in place end to end: zellij owns multiplexing under the
> `Ctrl+Space` leader, Ghostty is a plain renderer (no terminal leader), and
> `Alt+hjkl` moves focus seamlessly between Neovim splits and zellij panes.

## Hyprland Window Management

The **Super** key (Windows/Command key) is the main modifier.

## Ghostty Terminal

Ghostty is a plain, chrome-less renderer. **Multiplexing — tabs, splits,
panes — is owned by zellij** (see the next section), so Ghostty defines no
terminal leader of its own. Dropping the old `Ctrl+A` prefix also frees it as
readline "beginning of line" when you run `devc claude` in a plain window.

Ghostty keeps just two custom binds (plus its built-in copy/paste and
scrollback defaults):

| Keybinding | Action |
|------------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Shift+N` | New window (for local console work outside the multiplexer) |
| `Ctrl+Shift+,` | Reload config |
| `Ctrl+Shift+C` / `V` | Copy / paste (Ghostty default) |

---

## zellij (devcube multiplexer)

Inside `devc`, **zellij** is the terminal multiplexer — it manages your panes,
tabs, and sessions, and each parallel agent (workmux worktree) is a zellij tab.

The leader is **`Ctrl+Space`**. Tap it to enter **HYPER mode**, then press one
key. Every key runs its action and returns to Normal, so it reads like a leader
sequence — `Ctrl+Space |` splits, `Ctrl+Space c` makes a tab. There is only one
mode to learn. `Esc` / `Enter` leaves HYPER mode.

### Panes

| Keybinding | Action |
|------------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Space` `\|` | Split right (vertical) |
| `Ctrl+Space` `-` | Split down (horizontal) |
| `Ctrl+Space` `n` | New pane |
| `Ctrl+Space` `x` | Close pane |
| `Ctrl+Space` `z` | Toggle zoom/fullscreen |
| `Ctrl+Space` `w` | Toggle floating panes |
| `Ctrl+Space` `e` | Embed / float pane |
| `Ctrl+Space` `h/j/k/l` | Move focus |
| `Ctrl+Space` `H/J/K/L` | Move the pane |

### Tabs (workmux worktrees)

| Keybinding | Action |
|------------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Space` `c` | New tab |
| `Ctrl+Space` `[` / `]` | Previous / next tab |
| `Ctrl+Space` `1`–`9` | Jump to tab _n_ |
| `Ctrl+Space` `,` | Rename tab |

### Resize, session, lock

| Keybinding | Action |
|------------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Space` `r` | Resize sub-mode (then `h/j/k/l` or `+`/`-`; `Esc` exits) |
| `Ctrl+Space` `s` | Session manager |
| `Ctrl+Space` `d` | Detach session (leave agents running) |
| `Ctrl+Space` `q` | Quit session |
| `Ctrl+Space` `g` | Lock — pass every key to a focused TUI; `Ctrl+Space` again unlocks |

### No leader needed

These work everywhere, no mode required:

| Keybinding | Action |
|------------|--------|
| `Alt + h/j/k/l` | Move focus (hops between tabs at the edges) |
| `Alt + =` / `Alt + -` | Grow / shrink pane |

> **Seamless with Neovim.** `Alt+hjkl` also steps *into* and out of Neovim's
> own splits, so the editor ↔ agent boundary needs no gear-change. Inside `devc`
> this is handled by `zellij-autolock` (holds zellij in locked mode while nvim is
> focused, so the keys reach nvim) plus `zellij-nav.nvim` (does the in-editor
> move and hands off to the next zellij pane at the edge). On first launch zellij
> asks once to grant the autolock plugin its permissions.

## workmux (parallel agents)

[workmux](https://github.com/raine/workmux) orchestrates parallel agents on top of
zellij: each `workmux add` creates a git worktree and opens it as **its own zellij
tab** running the agent. So workmux has no separate keybindings — you navigate its
worktrees with the zellij tab keys above (`Ctrl+Space [` / `]` or `Ctrl+Space 1-9`).

| Command (run in any pane) | Action |
|---|---|
| `workmux add <branch> "<prompt>"` | New worktree + zellij tab running the agent |
| `workmux list` | Show worktrees + agent status |
| `workmux merge <branch>` | Merge and clean up |
| `workmux remove <branch>` | Remove without merging |
| `workmux dashboard` | Live control center (the default `devc` layout) |
