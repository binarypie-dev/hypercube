# High Level Idea
We are going to create a single command panel that will start from our launcher base.
This means that to do anything on the system is only a single shortcut.

When launched the command panel will overlay the screen with a blur and the content in a box in the center. 

--------------------------------------------------------
| date/time, weather, system tray, wifi, bluetooth, etc..       |
--------------------------------------------------------
| Perforamnce metrics cpu, ram, disk, temps, etc..     |
--------------------------------------------------------
| > Enter Command                                      |
--------------------------------------------------------
| Command content goes here                            |
--------------------------------------------------------

Now for example simply typing will launch an application
cmd+s | /[text] (3+ letters) will search users's files
cmd+n | /notifications or /n  will show notifications
cmd+w | /weather will show the detailed weather for the week
cmd+p | /performance or /p will show more detailed performance metrics
cmd+b | /bluetooth or /b will show bluetooth controls (device pairing, etc..)
cmd+w | /wifi or /w will show wifi controls (status, connect, disconnect, etc..)
cmd+c | /calendar or /c will show a nice calendar widget
